==================================
Wooble Effect by Vinicius Develops
==================================

This is a simple shader that gives a 
woobling movement. You can use this as
a camera effect or on your textures.

By default, you can adjust some settings like the 
wobbling intensity and speed. But feel free to ajust it
at your needs, taking into account any side effect it might occur.

The package contains a demo scene showing
the effect under water, in the "WaterCamera.cs"
script, located in "Wobble Effect/Sample Scene/Other".

Any questions regarding this package, you can send-me
an email at vncastanheira@gmail.com. 
If you have any issue, please be objective and attach an 
image, video or code snippet, so I can reproduce your 
problem.

Thanks for your acquisition and I hope it would be
very useful on your projects!
