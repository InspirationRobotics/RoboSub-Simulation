# Get started

Team Inspiration's RoboSubSim project was inspired after an influx of Sim2Real products developing in the robotics society. Sim2Real, or simulation-to-real, is the primary concept of transferring the robot skills developed through simulation into the reality. 

The RoboSubSim project is contructed through Unity3D, a game engine, primarily utilized to create simulations and video games. Please note that this simulation is free and does not contain any paid assets through the Unity Asset Store.

The project is a community tool. This simulation serves teams with the purpose to assist in testing their computer vision code, autonomous code, and more in the simulated environment of the Transdec Facility. The 3D model of the Transdec Environment can be found from [PWR Diving Crew's Simulation](https://github.com/pwrdc/TransdecEnvironment). Through the data received by the simulation, teams can then modify their code and implement their code for the in-person RoboSub Competition in 2022.  

  For more information on the simulation and how Team Inspiration developed this community tool, please check our Technical Paper below.
