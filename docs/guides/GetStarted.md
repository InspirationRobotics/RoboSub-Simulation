# Get started
This guide is created to provide guidance to setup the RoboSubSim-Simulation. To run the simulator on your computer, please install these applications if you do not have them uploaded.  

## Unity
Unity is software engine created to mainly develop games or simulators. It supports scripting in many coding languages. Unity has excellent documentation if ever you face any issues in installing this product. For instructions on installation, please look at [Unity's Installation Guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html).

### Downloading Unity
We recommend downloading Unity Hub when running the simulator. The project is currently using Unity 2020.3.4.f1. Both the Unity Hub and the Unity Editor can be downloaded through Unity's [website](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

## Python
To implement the Python clients to run the simulator, please open the code through preferably Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded through the [VSC website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## The Environment 
Once Unity is installed, please clone the RoboSub-Simulation Github by executing this command in Git:

`git clone https://github.com/InspirationRobotics/RoboSub-Simulation.git`

After the installation on your computer through the command above, follow this [Unity Guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted.html) to open the "RoboSubSim" project.

If you don't have any experience with Unity, please read [this guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html) to gain an understanding of the functions of Unity before starting the simulator.

Now, please read the guide on how to open the default Transdec Environment developed by our team.
